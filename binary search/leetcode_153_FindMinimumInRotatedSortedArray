Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array [Medium]
https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/

Solution 1
[idea]
Split the array into two blocks, compare each blocks' first or last elements, take smaller one's block and repeat.

[code]
class Solution:
    def findMin(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        low, high = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while low < high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            
            if nums[high] < nums[mid]:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid
                
        return nums[low]

time complexity : O(logn)
space complexity : O(1)
